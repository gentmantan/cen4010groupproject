abstract={Blood analyses for rare-earth element (REE)-high background regions in South Jiangxi show that the population averages of many of the biochemical indices deviate markedly from normal values in the normal region. These deviations are thought to be caused by prolonged intake of REE through food chains in view of that the toxicity of other harmful metals such as Pb and Cd can be neglected because of their insignificant amounts in the environment. In comparison with the normal region, blood biochemical indices abnormal in the REE-high regions are manifested as low total serum protein (TSP), albumin, $\beta$-globulin, glutamic pyruvic transitanase, serium triglycerides, and immunoglobulin, but high cholesterol. These deviations may be related to the REE concentration and composition of food chains, and are sex dependent. Certain blood indices (such as TSP) of different age groups in the LREE-high region indicate that the influence of REE on males is a one-way irreversible process, whereas females show a strong ability of restoration.},

abstract={To investigate the concentrations of rare earth elements in cereals and assess human health risk through cereal consumption, a total of 327 cereal samples were collected from rare earth mining area and control area in Shandong, China. The contents of 14 rare earth elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma---Mass Spectrometry (ICP---MS). The medians of total rare earth elements in cereals from mining and control areas were 74.22{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg and 47.83{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). The wheat had the highest rare earth elements concentrations (109.39{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg and 77.96{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg for mining and control areas, respectively) and maize had the lowest rare earth elements concentrations (42.88{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg and 30.25{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg for mining and control areas, respectively). The rare earth elements distribution patterns for both areas were characterized by enrichment of light rare earth elements. The health risk assessment demonstrated that the estimated daily intakes of rare earth elements through cereal consumption were considerably lower than the acceptable daily intake (70{\thinspace}$\mu$g/kg bw). The damage to adults can be neglected, but more attention should be paid to the effects of continuous exposure to rare earth elements on children.},
