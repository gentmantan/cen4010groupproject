\section{Introduction}

With the prevalence of information technologies, there exists an ever-increasing need for individuals to secure one's own access to online accounts. The typical method of doing so requires the user to create a secret passphrase that they would then be responsible for memorizing in order to access a given system. However, several factors make such a task difficult and unsafe; first, the exponential rise in computational power has led to the feasibility of "brute force attacks", in turn forcing IT administrators to enforce increased password length and complexity. Another effect that the increase in password length has is making the memorization of multiple different passwords difficult, thereby incentivizing individuals to unsafely reuse their own passwords. With these shortcomings in mind, we propose a system that would solve all of these issues in a single package.

\subsection{Purpose of system}
Solve the security issues facing PC end users in the realm of password authentication

\subsection{Scope of the system}
In scope: Multi-platform mobile application, password management, multi-platform USB keyboard emulation, mitigation against man-in-the-middle, replay and spoofing attacks
Out of scope: Application data security, side-channel attacks

\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}

\begin{APAitemize}
  \item Provide a mobile app for users to create and store passwords
  \item Provide a USB hardware dongle that can be paired with the mobile app which can type in passwords in lieu of keyboard input
\end{APAitemize}

\subsection{Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations}

\begin{APAitemize}
  \item PassUSB: the project's USB dongle solution that emulates a USB keyboard
  \item Password manager: a computer program that generates, stores and retrieves passswords for its users
  \item HID (Human Interface Device): a computer device that facilitates communications between a computer user and a computer 
  \item App: a computer application
  \item Pairing: the process of recognition and acknowledgement between the mobile device and USB dongle
\end{APAitemize}

\subsection{Overview of document}
The project will consist of two types of coding assignments, one for frontend development i.e. mobile app development, and the other for backend development i.e. microcontroller programming. The mobile app will prompt the user to create a new password database, in which he/she will then enter a master password that is to be used to secure the database. The user will be given an option to pair the PassUSB with the app. Should the user choose to or not choose to pair the PassUSB, the user is then able to utilize the app's password generation, management and storage features.

\section{Current System}
Without password managers, users are succeptable to password leaks which can lead to the exploitation of other accounts that the user owns if the same password is used. Also, the memorization of increasingly entropic passwords for many accounts is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. Password managers presently exist to solve these issues; however, the login process can be tedious if the application or website that is to be logged into is on a device that has not been set up with a user's password manager and account database.

\section{Project Plan}

The project will span a 7 week timeline and will be made possible via the use of various hardware and software components. Due to the PassUSB system's design specification requiring the usage of various forms of hardware communicating via the interference-prone protocol Bluetooth, regular testing must be performed to ensure the minimization of software faults.

\subsection{Use Cases}

\scriptsize{\begin{xltabular}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
  \hline Use Case ID: & UC-1-AA \\ \hline

  Use Case Name: & Add account \\ \hline

  Created By: Rey Jairus Marasigan & Last Updated By: Rey Jairus Marasigan \\ \hline

  Date Created: February 21, 2022 & Last Revision Date: February 21, 2022 \\ \hline

  Actors: & \nextitem User \\ \hline

  Description: &  This use case is used for specifying the different elements of our system that the DeviceUser goes through to add an entry to a list of account entries within our app. The ideal outcome of this use case is that the account is added to the database without any adverse effects. \\ \hline

  Trigger: & The user presses the plus icon on the top right of the UI. \\ \hline

  Preconditions: & \nextitem The User has created a database \nextitem The User has opened the app and unlocked their database \nextitem The User is in the correct directory to be able to see and touch the plus icon. \\ \hline

  Postconditions: & \nextitem At minimum: the system retains consistency and integrity in case of an error or deviation from the flow of events i.e. the user can “add account” again without repercussions from previous try.
    \nextitem Everything in harmony and works without error: Account is added to the database.
    \nextitem The account added can be accessed after being saved to the database. \\ \hline

  Normal Flow: & 
  (assumes the user wants to generate password when adding the account)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The DeviceUser presses the plus icon on the top right
    \item The view switches to a display that shows 3 text fields: a website field, a username and a password field. The first two will be required to be filled using the pop-up keyboard. The password field can either be manually filled or automatically generated using the associated button located to its left. <generate password use case>
    \item The user presses a button that opens to another view that shows multiple fields, boxes, and sliders to be filled, checked, and adjusted, respectively, to meet a certain criteria associated with the password.
    \item The user enters the field with a pop-up keyboard on their phone.
    \item Below the fields, the users checks various boxes or switches that configures the password generated by the apps such as:
      \nextitem contains special characters- an option that includes special characters in the password
      \nextitem contains numbers- an option that includes number
      \nextitem etc.
  \item Below the switches, there exists a slider that controls how long the password will be. When it is adjusted towards the right, it increases the length. When it is adjusted towards the left, it decreases the length. The maximum length of the slider occupies the entire width of the screen with some deadzone. The minimum length is 8 characters and the maximum is 32 characters. Initially the slider is set to 12.
  \item As the user changes the length of the desired password, a text box that shows the password itself changes. The password is shown in its pure form i.e. the actual password to be used. Here, the password is changeable by pressing on the box and using the pop-up keyboard. Initially, the password generated here is from the combination of the slider and checkboxes.
  \item The user then presses the "save password" button below to generate the password. <generate password use case>
  \item The user finally then presses the “add account” button below to add the account to the list.
  \item A notification pops up that lets the user know that the account has been added.
  \item The state of the app then returns to its default view.
  \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

 Alternative Flows: & \nextitemblank 2b. In step 2 of the normal flow, if the user chooses to manually enter the password rather than generate a new password,
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item The entire normal flow can skip to step 9
   \end{enumerate}
   \nextitemblank 7b. In step 7 of the normal flow, if the user changes the generated password and then slides the password slider,
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item An entirely different password is generated.
     \item The new password is instantly displayed within the text box.
     \item The normal use case continues thereafter on step 7 where the user can edit the newly generated password.
   \end{enumerate}
   \nextitemblank 9b. In step 9 of the normal flow, if the website field and username field is not filled
     \begin{enumerate}
     \item A notification pops up to let the user know about the required fields
     \item The app is scrolled the field needed to be filled
     \item The fields are highlighted red to indicate requirement. 
     \item The keyboard pops up automatically
     \item Once the fields are filled, the use case enters step 8 of the normal flow.
     \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

   Exceptions: & Exceptions to adding account to list
     \nextitemblank 9b. In step 9 of the normal flow, if the user does not enter a website or username. \\ \hline

   Includes: & editAccount- steps 3 to 7 would be required to edit an entry within the list and can be separated in its own use case \\ \hline

     \nextitem Application should be made available on all major mobile platforms \\ \hline


   Assumptions: & \nextitem The Customer has installed and is using the application
     \nextitem The application is readable to the Customer
     \nextitem The client has the ability to use the keyboard and interact with the screen. \\ \hline

   Notes and Issues: & \nextitem Is the minimum and maximum possible length of the password generator feasible for the users?
     \nextitem Should there be a limit to the amount of accounts added to the list?
     \nextitem What are the different switches that we can include in the forum?
     \nextitem should the app request for the master password (the password required to enter the app)or other biometrics for the ability to add an entry to the list?
     \nextitem Should we use other characters outside of the printable ascii characters? \\ \hline

  Description: & This use case specifies the process of which a database is backed up onto an external storage device \\ \hline

  Trigger: & The DeviceUser presses the 'backup' button. \\ \hline

  Preconditions: & \nextitem The DeviceUser is logged in on their personal device such as a cellphone where the app is located \nextitem The DeviceUser has the app opened \nextitem The DeviceUser has created a database \nextitem The DeviceUser has logged into a database \\ \hline

  Postconditions: & \nextitem An encrypted container containing the database is created on a user selected external storage device  \\ \hline

  Normal Flow: &
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The DeviceUser presses the 'backup' menu entry.
      \item The DeviceUser is shown a system directory chooser and is prompted to select a directory to be used to save the database backup
      \item The DeviceUser chooses a directory
      \item The DeviceUser is prompted to enter a password twice to be used to secure the backup file and enters a password
      \item The DeviceUser receives confirmation that the account database is backed up onto the specified directory with the filename passusb-<date>.bak, where <date> would be in the format MMDDYYYY, for example 01012001 for January 1, 2001.
    \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

  Alternative Flows: &
                       \nextitemblank 3a. In step 3, a file of the same name as the backup file already exists
                       \begin{enumerate}
                               \item The DeviceUser is prompted in a dialog box that a file of the same name as the new backup
                               \item In the same dialog box DeviceUser is presented with the button options 'overwrite file', 'rename backup file' or 'cancel'
                               \item If the DeviceUser chooses the 'overwrite file' button, the file existing on the external storage device is overwritten. If the DeviceUser chooses the 'rename backup file' option, a string ``(<num>)'' is appended to the new file, where <num> starts from 1 and is incremented if a new filename already exists. If the DeviceUser chooses the 'cancel' option, the Backup Database subroutine exits.
                       \end{enumerate}
                       \nextitemblank 4a. In step 4, the DeviceUser does not enter a password
                       \begin{enumerate}
                               \item The DeviceUser is prompted that storing an unencrypted database can be unsafe, and that it is recommended to enter a password. The user can choose the 'Back' button to return to the beginning of step 4, or the 'Continue Anyways' button to continue saving the unencrypted backup of the account database
                       \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

  Exceptions: &
                \nextitemblank 3b. In step 3, the directory is unwriteable
                       \begin{enumerate}
                               \item The DeviceUser is prompted that the directory that has been chosen is invalid and is presented the corresponding error (for example, directory is read only)
                               \item The DeviceUser is presented with button options to either choose a new directory or cancel the backup procedure
                       \end{enumerate}
                 \nextitemblank 3b. In step 3, the directory does not have enough free space to store the database backup
                       \begin{enumerate}
                               \item The DeviceUser is prompted with an error dialog notifying that the chosen directory does not have enough free space, and is presented with a 'choose another directory' button to restart step 3 or a 'cancel' button to exit the backup

\subsection{Scenarios}

Backup Database: The DeviceUser decides they would like to create an external backup of their account database. To do so, they open the PassUSB app, open their existing account database, press the drop-down menu button and press the menu entry titled ``Backup Database''. In doing so, a system directory chooser menu will appear prompting the user to choose a suitable directory to store the database backup. The DeviceUser then navigates to the path of their external storage device, and presses the ``Backup To This Directory'' button to choose the directory that will store the database backup. Then, the user is asked to enter a password twice to be used to encrypt the backup file. Once the user confirms the password to be used to backup the file, the backup procedure begins and the user is shown a throbber during the process. After the backup process is complete, the User is notified that the backup has been successfully saved, and is given the name of the saved backup file. The User is brought back to the list of accounts menu.

Create account entry group: After opening their existing account database, the DeviceUser decides they would like to create a group to organize their account entries better. To do so, they press the button labeled with the $+$ symbol and then press the ``Add group'' button. The DeviceUser is then presented a dialog box prompting them to enter a name for the group as well as the option to edit the symbol emoji associated with the group which by default is that of a folder. Once the DeviceUser is satisfied with their editing they can then press the ``Add''  button. After the folder has been added to the database, the DeviceUser is brought back to the account list view.
