\section{Introduction}

With the prevalence of information technologies, there exists an ever-increasing need for individuals to secure one's own access to online accounts. The typical method of doing so requires the user to create a secret passphrase that they would then be responsible for memorizing in order to access a given system. However, several factors make such a task difficult and unsafe; first, the exponential rise in computational power has led to the feasibility of "brute force attacks", in turn forcing IT administrators to enforce increased password length and complexity. Another effect that the increase in password length has is making the memorization of multiple different passwords difficult, thereby incentivizing individuals to unsafely reuse their own passwords. With these shortcomings in mind, we propose a system that would solve all of these issues in a single package.

\subsection{Purpose of system}
Solve the security issues facing PC end users in the realm of password authentication

\subsection{Scope of the system}
In scope: Multi-platform mobile application, password management, multi-platform USB keyboard emulation, mitigation against man-in-the-middle, replay and spoofing attacks
Out of scope: Application data security, side-channel attacks

\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide a mobile app for users to create and store passwords
  \item Provide a USB hardware dongle that can be paired with the mobile app which can type in passwords in lieu of keyboard input
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item PassUSB: the project's USB dongle solution that emulates a USB keyboard
  \item Password manager: a computer program that generates, stores and retrieves passswords for its users
  \item HID (Human Interface Device): a computer device that facilitates communications between a computer user and a computer 
  \item App: a computer application
  \item Pairing: the process of recognition and acknowledgement between the mobile device and USB dongle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview of document}
The project will consist of two types of coding assignments, one for frontend development i.e. mobile app development, and the other for backend development i.e. microcontroller programming. The mobile app will prompt the user to create a new password database, in which he/she will then enter a master password that is to be used to secure the database. The user will be given an option to pair the PassUSB with the app. Should the user choose to or not choose to pair the PassUSB, the user is then able to utilize the app's password generation, management and storage features.

\section{Current System}
Without password managers, users are succeptable to password leaks which can lead to the exploitation of other accounts that the user owns if the same password is used. Also, the memorization of increasingly entropic passwords for many accounts is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. Password managers presently exist to solve these issues; however, the login process can be tedious if the application or website that is to be logged into is on a device that has not been set up with a user's password manager and account database.

\section{Project Plan}

The project will span a 7 week timeline and will be made possible via the use of various hardware and software components. Due to the PassUSB system's design specification requiring the usage of various forms of hardware communicating via the interference-prone protocol Bluetooth, regular testing must be performed to ensure the minimization of software faults.

\subsection{Use Cases}

\small{\begin{xltabular}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
  \hline Use Case ID: & UC-1-AA \\ \hline

  Use Case Name: & Add account \\ \hline

  Created By: Rey Jairus Marasigan & Last Updated By: Rey Jairus Marasigan \\ \hline

  Date Created: February 21, 2022 & Last Revision Date: February 21, 2022 \\ \hline

  Actors: & \nextitem User \\ \hline

  Description: &  This use case is used for specifying the different elements of our system that the DeviceUser goes through to add an entry to a list of account entries within our app. The ideal outcome of this use case is that the account is added to the database without any adverse effects. \\ \hline

  Trigger: & The user presses the plus icon on the top right of the UI. \\ \hline

  Preconditions: & \nextitem The User has created a database \nextitem The User has opened the app and unlocked their database \nextitem The User is in the correct directory to be able to see and touch the plus icon. \\ \hline

  Postconditions: & \nextitem At minimum: the system retains consistency and integrity in case of an error or deviation from the flow of events i.e. the user can “add account” again without repercussions from previous try.
    \nextitem Everything in harmony and works without error: Account is added to the database.
    \nextitem The account added can be accessed after being saved to the database. \\ \hline

  Normal Flow: & 
  (assumes the user wants to generate password when adding the account)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The DeviceUser presses the plus icon on the top right
    \item The view switches to a display that shows 3 text fields: a website field, a username and a password field. The first two will be required to be filled using the pop-up keyboard. The password field can either be manually filled or automatically generated using the associated button located to its left. <generate password use case>
    \item The user presses a button that opens to another view that shows multiple fields, boxes, and sliders to be filled, checked, and adjusted, respectively, to meet a certain criteria associated with the password.
    \item The user enters the field with a pop-up keyboard on their phone.
    \item Below the fields, the users checks various boxes or switches that configures the password generated by the apps such as:
      \nextitem contains special characters- an option that includes special characters in the password
      \nextitem contains numbers- an option that includes number
      \nextitem etc.
  \item Below the switches, there exists a slider that controls how long the password will be. When it is adjusted towards the right, it increases the length. When it is adjusted towards the left, it decreases the length. The maximum length of the slider occupies the entire width of the screen with some deadzone. The minimum length is 8 characters and the maximum is 32 characters. Initially the slider is set to 12.
  \item As the user changes the length of the desired password, a text box that shows the password itself changes. The password is shown in its pure form i.e. the actual password to be used. Here, the password is changeable by pressing on the box and using the pop-up keyboard. Initially, the password generated here is from the combination of the slider and checkboxes.
  \item The user then presses the "save password" button below to generate the password. <generate password use case>
  \item The user finally then presses the “add account” button below to add the account to the list.
  \item A notification pops up that lets the user know that the account has been added.
  \item The state of the app then returns to its default view.
  \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

 Alternative Flows: & \nextitemblank 2b. In step 2 of the normal flow, if the user chooses to manually enter the password rather than generate a new password,
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item The entire normal flow can skip to step 9
   \end{enumerate}
   \nextitemblank 7b. In step 7 of the normal flow, if the user changes the generated password and then slides the password slider,
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item An entirely different password is generated.
     \item The new password is instantly displayed within the text box.
     \item The normal use case continues thereafter on step 7 where the user can edit the newly generated password.
   \end{enumerate}
   \nextitemblank 9b. In step 9 of the normal flow, if the website field and username field is not filled
     \begin{enumerate}
     \item A notification pops up to let the user know about the required fields
     \item The app is scrolled the field needed to be filled
     \item The fields are highlighted red to indicate requirement. 
     \item The keyboard pops up automatically
     \item Once the fields are filled, the use case enters step 8 of the normal flow.
     \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

   Exceptions: & Exceptions to adding account to list
     \nextitemblank 9b. In step 9 of the normal flow, if the user does not enter a website or username. \\ \hline

   Includes: & editAccount- steps 3 to 7 would be required to edit an entry within the list and can be separated in its own use case \\ \hline

     \nextitem Application should be made available on all major mobile platforms \\ \hline


   Assumptions: & \nextitem The Customer has installed and is using the application
     \nextitem The application is readable to the Customer
     \nextitem The client has the ability to use the keyboard and interact with the screen. \\ \hline

   Notes and Issues: & \nextitem Is the minimum and maximum possible length of the password generator feasible for the users?
     \nextitem Should there be a limit to the amount of accounts added to the list?
     \nextitem What are the different switches that we can include in the forum?
     \nextitem should the app request for the master password (the password required to enter the app)or other biometrics for the ability to add an entry to the list?
     \nextitem Should we use other characters outside of the printable ascii characters? \\ \hline

  Description: & This use case specifies the process of which a database is backed up onto an external storage device \\ \hline

  Trigger: & The DeviceUser presses the 'backup' button. \\ \hline

  Preconditions: & \nextitem The DeviceUser is logged in on their personal device such as a cellphone where the app is located \nextitem The DeviceUser has the app opened \nextitem The DeviceUser has created a database \nextitem The DeviceUser has logged into a database \\ \hline

  Postconditions: & \nextitem An encrypted container containing the database is created on a user selected external storage device  \\ \hline

  Normal Flow: &
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The DeviceUser presses the 'backup' menu entry.
      \item The DeviceUser is shown a system directory chooser and is prompted to select a directory to be used to save the database backup
      \item The DeviceUser chooses a directory
      \item The DeviceUser is prompted to enter a password twice to be used to secure the backup file and enters a password
      \item The DeviceUser receives confirmation that the account database is backed up onto the specified directory with the filename passusb-<date>.bak, where <date> would be in the format MMDDYYYY, for example 01012001 for January 1, 2001.
    \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

  Use Case Name: & Check Database for Account Data Compromise \\ \hline

  Created By: Rey Jairus Marasigan & Last Updated By: Rey Jairus Marasigan \\ \hline

  Date Created: April 6, 2022 & Last Revision Date: April 6, 2022 \\ \hline

  Actors: & \nextitem DeviceUser \nextitem HIBP (haveibeenpwned.com) \nextitem MobileDevice \\ \hline

  Description: & This use case is used when the DeviceUser wants to check if their passwords are safe to be used periodically using the email associated with their accounts. The ideal outcome for the use case is that the DeviceUser is notified of one of two events, a breach or not a breach. \\ \hline

  Trigger: & The event that initiates this use case could either be on demand of the DeviceUser through a specific button on the app or be from timely checks every so often passively. This use case will be focusing on the latter. \\ \hline

  Preconditions: & \nextitem The device has an internet connection.
                   \nextitem There is an established connection between HIBP with an API key set. (from agree to breach checks use case)
                   \nextitem There is at least one entry(account) in the database with a recovery email associated.
                   \nextitem The DeviceUser has checked the option to receive checks in the settings. \\ \hline

  Postconditions: & \nextitem The DeviceUser is notified of either events of being compromised or being safe.
                    \nextitem In the event of some accounts being compromised, the breach accounts are highlighted until they are modified within the app.
                    \nextitem At minimum, the data in the database is not compromised to the third party password verifier. \\ \hline

  Normal Flow: &
                 \begin{enumerate}
                   \item After pressing the switch to agree for periodic checks of their accounts, the DeviceUser closes the app and turns off the screen of their phone (not entirely where their phone is powered off).
                   \item Depending on the amount of time they specified for the checks, the app sends the DeviceUser a notification on the status of their accounts every so often.
                   \item During a check, the app passively sends a query to HIBP for all the accounts retrieved from the database through database queries.
                   \item In the case of accounts being compromised, a notification appears on the MobileDevice that shows a red X symbol alongside with a message indicating which accounts may have been compromised.
                   \item Upon pressing the notification, the app opens up to the log-in page that asks for the master password or other biometrics to get access into the list/database.
                   \item After logging in, the device opens the app to the main/usual UI that shows the entire list of accounts  with certain entries highlighted in red indicating a possible breach.
                   \item Pressing on one of the highlighted accounts brings up the usual editAccount use case. However,  it will display a banner on the top to indicate urgency to change the password of the email associated with the account.
                   \item The DeviceUser selects all highlighted accounts and modifies them. The state of the app then reverts back to its usual state.
                \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

  Alternative Flows: &
                       \nextitemblank 4a. In step 4 of the normal flow, if the accounts are not breached,
                       \begin{enumerate}
                         \item The notification shows a green check mark alongside a reassuring message.
                         \item Pressing on it opens the app to a pop-up screen that shows a more specific description based on the aforementioned message.
                         \item The screen has a button on the top right to close the pop-up message and reverts to the log-in screen to access the database.
                       \end{enumerate}
                       \nextitemblank  8a. In step 8 of the normal flow, if the customer does not change the highlighted accounts,
                       \begin{enumerate}
                         \item The state of the app will remain with the accounts still highlighted.
                         \item The DeviceUser closes the app.
                         \item The DeviceUser logins into the app later on, the state of the list will be the same as in step 6 after logging in.
                       \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

  Exceptions: &
                3a. In step 3 of the normal flow, if the app is unable to reach HIBP,
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item The app will go through the connect to HIBP use case.
                  \item If successful the use case will continue back on step 3
                \end{enumerate} \\ \hline

  Includes: & \nextitemblank Edit Account: step 7 of the normal flow for the user to edit the account that needs to be modified.
              \nextitemblank Logging into app: step 5 in the normal flow for the user to login into the app.
              \nextitemblank Query HIBP: step 3 in the normal flow requires the specification of how the app interacts with HIBP.
              \nextitemblank Agree to Breach Checks: a use case used for the preconditions.

              \nextitemblank Lock App - step 8 in the normal flow where the DeviceUser is done modifying the account and exits. \\ \hline

  Frequency of Use: & Depends on the frequency placed set by use case Agree to breach checks, can be from daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, or yearly \\ \hline

  Special Requirements: & \nextitem Users should not wait >20 seconds for an action to be performed
                          \nextitem Animations should last <250ms

\section{Reqirements Analysis}

\subsection{Scenarios}

\textbf{Backup Database:} The DeviceUser decides they would like to create an external backup of their account database. To do so, they open the PassUSB app, open their existing account database, press the drop-down menu button and press the menu entry titled ``Backup Database''. In doing so, a system directory chooser menu will appear prompting the user to choose a suitable directory to store the database backup. The DeviceUser then navigates to the path of their external storage device, and presses the ``Backup To This Directory'' button to choose the directory that will store the database backup. Then, the user is asked to enter a password twice to be used to encrypt the backup file. Once the user confirms the password to be used to backup the file, the backup procedure begins and the user is shown a throbber during the process. After the backup process is complete, the User is notified that the backup has been successfully saved, and is given the name of the saved backup file. The User is brought back to the list of accounts menu.

\textbf{Create Account Entry Group:} After opening their existing account database, the DeviceUser decides they would like to create a group to organize their account entries better. To do so, they press the button labeled with the $+$ symbol and then press the ``Add group'' button. The DeviceUser is then presented a dialog box prompting them to enter a name for the group as well as the option to edit the symbol emoji associated with the group which by default is that of a folder. Once the DeviceUser is satisfied with their editing they can then press the ``Add''  button. After the folder has been added to the database, the DeviceUser is brought back to the account list view.

\textbf{Check Database for Account Data Compromise:} After pressing the switch to agree for periodic checks of their accounts, Jon closes the app and turns off the screen of their phone (not entirely where their phone is powered off). While Jon’s iPhone is turned off, the app passively checks the accounts stored for possible breaches through haveibeenpwned.com. The app sends Jon’s iPhone a notification on the status of their accounts every so often. After some time, a notification appears on Jon's iPhone that shows a red X symbol alongside with a message indicating which accounts may have been compromised. Upon pressing the notification, the app opens up to the log-in page that asks for the password or a scan of Jon’s face to get into the list of accounts. After Jon logs in using a master password, the app enters the main/usual page that shows the entire list of accounts but with certain account/entries highlighted in red indicating a possible breach. Jon presses on one of the highlighted accounts. This action brings up a page that allows Jon to change the password or other info with a banner on the top that indicates urgency. Jon then changes the password for the account.  Jon saves the changes and exits to the list of accounts by pressing a button on the top left. Jon changes the password of all the highlighted accounts through the previously mentioned steps and the state of the list of accounts reverts back to normal

\textbf{Copy Password to MobileDevice Clipboard:} While at the account screen, Jon sees a button next to each of the 4 text fields present. The button has a clipboard symbol. Jon presses the password clipboard button. The password is placed in the MobileDevice’s clipboard. Jon’s iPhone then clears the text from the clipboard after a certain amount of time.
