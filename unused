%having been clearly established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as the U.S. Global Change Research Program. 
%To meet these lofty conservational goals, governments are doing their part in enacting environmental policies and grants; the EUROP-E project which pays for 20\% of the costs to private companies in building a unified charging network, and tax credits for electric vehicles in the US are examples of these political actions.

%It is therefore important to analyze the ethical implications involved with the extraction and refining of raw resources for the production of electronics, in order to have the ability to make responsible decisions as to how such industries should be regulated.

produces 22.8 to 35.1 kg of CO\textsubscript{2} per kilogram of rare-earths as a byproduct} requires 315 to 579 megajoules per kilogram of energy to produce. This means that on average, the process is 20 times more energy energy intensive than that of steel \parencite{doi:10.1021/sc500573bA

Another ethical conflict arises with the ecological harm that rare-earth production in China inflicts onto humans and other living organisms. A 2016 case study finds surface water and shallow groundwater to be contaminated with rare earth elements and residual mining chemicals to such a degree that 50\% of well and spring water samples were considered impotable \parencite{Zhuang2017}. This polution puts low-income individiuals and the surrounding ecology at a disadvantage, and is an ethical conflict that must be addressed.
